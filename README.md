## Ethical Issues
1. **Be honest and trustworthy**. This ethical priciple is concerned with being transparent to your users about the services that
your app offers. With my implementation of the Yo App coming with an $11 premium membership, computing professionals should be 
transparent in what this membership offers. Yo Premium will turn the user's Yo's into a golden color, and 
the description in the Yo Store states this fact. Not being transparent with your customers is not ethical 
and will put you and your company in bad light.

2. **Contribute to society and to human well-being.** This principle concerns the quality of life of all people, and states that 
computing professionals should use their skills for the benefit of society.
This app contributes to society by adding a short and simple way to communicate
with others when a text or a call is far too inconvenient. Humans are social creatures and this app provides another way people can 
satiate this need.

3. **Respect privacy**. This ethical principle states computing professionals should respect the user's privacy when it comes to the
collection and use of personal information. This app stores a lot of personal information, such as e-mails, passwords, and phone numbers. Professionals should be wary in how they use this personal information. Additionally, with the implementation of the Yo Store, 
sensitive credit card and financial information needs to be protected from potential leaks.
In the EU, the principal data protection legislation is the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
It states that personal information cannot be disclosed without obtaining the subject's consent.

## Legal Issues
1. **Security Liability**. This legal issue pairs with the "respect privacy" ethical principle. Digital security is complicated, so
when sensitive information is stored, computing professionals should take proper percautions that this information does not get misused or leaked to the public. The Yo App stores a lot of sensitive information and it should be protected.

2. **Data Gathering**. This legal issue matches the "respect privacy" ethical principle with the "be honest and trustworthy" ethical principle. Users should consent to what data is being gathered about them, and computing professionals should be transparent about
what data is being gathered. One example of this legal issue being potentially violated is the Yo App theoretically tracking and storing users' locations without their consent or knowledge. Under the EU GDPR, subjects must opt-in and agree to have their personal data stored and/or re-used. Subjects can also change their mind at anytime and opt-out; at that point the company must immediately stop using his or her data.

3. **Digital Ownership**. With technology being more and more widespead, the ownership intellectual property has become a big legal topic. The Yo App must make application features unique to Yo, and be careful to not violate someone else's intellectual property. Likewise, the Yo App must be vigilant to ensure that their property is protected and is not violated.


## Professional Issues
1. **Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work**. The computing professionals who make the Yo App should strive to make their app as high quality as possible. They are representing the company through their software, and thus should put forth effort to make it outstanding in both functionality and user experience.

2. **Accept and provide appropriate professional review**. This helps facilitate the high quality that is expected from computing professionals. Computing professionals should seek help and professional review to ensure that this expectation of high quality software is maintained. Likewise, if a computing professional notices something awry, he or she should offer their professional expertise to fix the issue. 

3. **Perform work only in areas of competence**. Again, this helps facilitate high quality. Obviously, a software engineer without any knowledge in UX development should not be designing the user interface for the Yo App, he or she would be more beneficial working in their area of expertise. Having specialized experts working in their specific field ensures that each aspect of the application is outstanding.
