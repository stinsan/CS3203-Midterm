## Ethical Issues
1. **Be honest and trustworthy**. This ethical priciple is concerned with being transparent to your users about the services that
your app offers. With my implementation of the Yo App coming with an $11 premium membership, computing professionals should be 
transparent in what this membership offers. Yo Premium will turn the user's Yo's into a golden color, and 
the description in the Yo Store states this fact. Not being transparent with your customers is not ethical 
and will put you and your company in bad light.

2. **Contribute to society and to human well-being.** This principle concerns the quality of life of all people, and states that 
computing professionals should use their skills for the benefit of society.
This app contributes to society by adding a short and simple way to communicate
with others when a text or a call is far too inconvenient. Humans are social creatures and this app provides another way people can 
satiate this need.

3. **Respect privacy**. This ethical principle states computing professionals should respect the user's privacy when it comes to the
collection and use of personal information. This app stores a lot of personal information, such as e-mails, passwords, and phone numbers.
Professionals should be wary in how they use this personal information. Additionally, with the implementation of the Yo Store, 
sensitive credit card and financial information needs to be protected from potential leaks.
